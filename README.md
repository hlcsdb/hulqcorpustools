# hulqcorpustools
Some useful tools to be used in processing Hul’q’umi’num’ texts.

# NOTE ON USE
Right now, since everything is still under development and I (Zack) am still trying to get everything working under best practices, including modularizing everything to share resources needed by multiple functions, you can't really use any script directly. However, if you clone this repo and write scripts in another place (for example, currently I have them in /hulqcorpustools/tests/, not to be confused with the source dir /hulqcorpustools/hulqcorpustools/) and import things from the package that way, everything should work fine. Except for bugs, of course.

## hulqtransliterator
Transliterate one of the various ways of writing Hul’q’umi’num’ into another.
